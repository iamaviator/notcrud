### notCRUD

notCRUD is a platform for fostering discussions and collaborations between people who're interested in building better software products in India. Check out [notcrud.com](http://notcrud.com) and be a part of it!

notCRUD itself is based heavily on top of [NodeBB](https://github.com/NodeBB/NodeBB) which is absolutely awesome. If you'd like to fork the code, feel free to do so - docs are coming up pretty soon.
